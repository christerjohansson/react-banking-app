Personal banking application that uses PLAID api to collect information from your bank on your behalf.
Plaid has wonderful documentation for developers on how to integrate with their service. However, I couldn’t find any posts or videos that walked through building a full application (e.g. with databases, servers, authentication, UI frameworks) with Plaid. As someone who is deeply interested in financial technology, I thought I’d try my hand with Plaid and write about it.
